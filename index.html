     <h3>Brief history of the summer school, and motivation</h3>

The SMLP summer school was started by Shravan Vasishth in 2017, as part of a <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/projects/infrastructure-service-training-and-central-projects/project-q.html">methods project</a> funded within the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/sfb1287/index.html">SFB 1287</a>. The summer school aims to fill a gap in statistics education, specifically within the fields of linguistics and psychology. One goal of the summer school is to provide comprehensive training in the theory and application of statistics, with a special focus on the linear mixed model.  Another major goal is to make Bayesian data analysis a standard part of the toolkit for the linguistics and psychology researcher. Over time, the summer school has evolved to have at least four parallel streams: beginning and advanced courses in frequentist and Bayesian statistics. These may be expanded to more parallel sessions in future editions. We typically admit a total of 120 participants (in 2019, we had some 450 applications). In addition to the all-day courses, we regularly invite speakers to give lectures on important current issues relating to statistics. Previous editions of the summer school: <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2019/">2019</a>, <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/SMLP2018/">2018</a>, <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/SMLP2017/">2017</a>.
